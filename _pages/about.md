This page serves as a homepage and resources for various mathematical and philosophical works by me. 

I have been doing mathematics for more than 10 years now, and I want to share it with everyone!

My particular interest in mathematics is in foundations/category theory and algebraic geometry.

Recent projects include [latex-math](https://github.com/PrameTan/latex-math "latex-math") and thai-category.
