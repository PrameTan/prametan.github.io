This site serves as a personal webpage where I collect various mathematical and philosophical writings penned by me. Although not a lot of them exists currently. (This is of course
changing with time.)

## Biography

Here is a brief biography. I was born in 2000 in the Northeastern region of Thailand. After participating in the national mathematical olympiad, I developed a passion
for mathematics and decided to pursue it further. I graduated with a bachelor's degree from Khon Kaen University in 2023. Then I read mathematics for my Master's at Oxford for nine months.

Looking back now I realised I have been doing mathematics for more than 10 years, and I really want to share the joy of it with everyone!

My interests in mathematics are, but not limited to, the following areas:

* foundations & logic, particularly Gödel's incompleteness theorems,
* Lie algebras,
* algebraic geometry,
* Riemannian geometry and complex geometry,
* automated proofs using LEAN.

## What I am currently up to

Mostly reading Lie algebras (Carter), algebraic geometry (G&W), and complex geometry (Lee).

I am writing a note in Thai on a quick introduction to the proofs of Gödel's incompleteness theorems.

## Past Projects

Past projects include [latex-math](https://github.com/PrameTan/latex-math "latex-math"), no update in sight due to the sheer scope of it.
