<small>The pictures used are from [Niels Hendrik Abel's](https://www.abelprize.no/nedlastning/verker/abel_handskrift3_opt.pdf) and [Cauchy's](http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/medren/pageturn.html?id=MEDREN_9958856333503681&rotation=0&size=0&currentpage=2) manuscripts. The one in the foothead is from Abel's proof of the result that division of lemniscate by compass and straightedge is the same as circle division previously investigated by Gauss.</small>
