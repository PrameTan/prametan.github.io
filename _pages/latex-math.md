`latex-math` is an ongoing project. It provides lecture notes on various topics in undergraduate/graduate course mathematics. This could be useful for someone learning the subject.

My main goal for it is for referencing theorems, definitions etc. Also as a note when I read more stuffs.

The pdf file is available here:
