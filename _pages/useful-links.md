Here are some links I found quite useful.

### Mathematics

* [q.uiver.app](https://q.uiver.app/), a commutative diagram editor.
* [π-Base](https://topology.pi-base.org/), where you can search (counter-)example topological spaces by properties.
* [MacTutor](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/), biographies of mathematicians.
* Ravi Vakil's [advice for potential PhD students.](https://virtualmath1.stanford.edu/~vakil/potentialstudents.html)
* Terence Tao's [advice for young mathematicians.](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/)

Some enjoyable webpage to read:

* [Dominic Joyce](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/joyce/)
* [Tom Körner](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~twk10/)
* [Thomas Forster](https://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tef10/)

Some useful lecture notes:

* Eric Wei's [Homological algebra notes](https://github.com/EricWay1024/Homological-Algebra-Notes) based on the course at Oxford. While you are at it, check out his dissertation on [synthetic homotopy theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15693).
